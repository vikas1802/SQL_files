1.
show the name, continent and population of all countries ?
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world

2.
Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million ? (200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros)
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000

3.
Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million ?
HELP:How to calculate per capita GDP (per capita GDP is the GDP divided by the population GDP/population)
SELECT name ,
       (gdp/population)
from world
where population >= 200000000


4.
Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'?
Hint :  Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.
select name, population/1000000 from world
 where continent like 'south america';

5.

 select name, population from world
 where name in ('france','germany','italy')

Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area ?
select name , population , area from world 
where area > 3000000 or population > 250000000


8.
Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area ?

Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be included.
Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be included.

select name , population , area from world
 where area > 3000000 xor population > 250000000

9.
Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'?
 Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.
(For Americas show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.
Millions and billions
Missing decimals
For some version of SQL the division of an integer by an integer will be an integer. One way to prevent this is to divide by a floating point number such as 1000000.0.)

SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000, 2), ROUND (gdp/1000000000, 2) FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America';

10.
Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000 ?

(Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.)

SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population, -3) FROM world
WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000;

11.
Greece has capital Athens.
Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.
Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters ?
You can use the LENGTH function to find the number of characters in a string.

WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);

12.
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.

Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word ?
You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character.
You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.

SELECT name, capital FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital, 1) AND name <> capital;

13.
Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.
Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name ?
You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'

SELECT name
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%A%' AND name LIKE '%E%' AND name LIKE '%I%' AND name LIKE '%O%' AND name LIKE '%U%'
  AND name NOT LIKE '% %';
