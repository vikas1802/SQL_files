1.
List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'?
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

2.
Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'?
(Per Capita GDP
The per capita GDP is the gdp/population)
select name from world where continent = 'europe' and gdp/population > (select gdp/population from world where name = 'united kingdom')

3.
List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country ?
SELECT name, continent FROM world
WHERE continent IN ('South America', 'Insular Oceania')
ORDER BY name;

4.
Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population ?
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE population >
    (SELECT population FROM world
    WHERE name = 'United kingdom')
AND population <
    (SELECT population FROM world
    WHERE name = 'germany');


5.
Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

The format should be Name, Percentage for example:

name	percentage
Albania	3%
Andorra	0%
Austria	11%
...	...
Decimal places
You can use the function ROUND to remove the decimal places.
Percent symbol %

SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany') * 100), '%') FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe';


6.
Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE gdp >= ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world
                    WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp>0)
AND continent != 'Europe';


7.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area ?
The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world as x
WHERE area >= ALL
  (SELECT area FROM world as y
      WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0);

8.
List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically ?
SELECT continent, name FROM world as a
WHERE name <= ALL
  (SELECT name FROM world as b
      WHERE b.continent=a.continent);

9.
Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population ?
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
WHERE continent IN
  (SELECT continent FROM world as g
    WHERE
      (SELECT MAX(population) FROM world as v
        WHERE g.continent = v.continent) <= 25000000);

10.
Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents ?
SELECT name, continent FROM world as A
WHERE population > ALL
	(SELECT 3*population FROM world as B
		WHERE B.continent=A.continent AND A.name <> B.name);
